### 🌟 About Me
I’m a passionate MERN Stack Developer who loves transforming ideas into functional, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. Along with development, I actively practice Data Structures and Algorithms — solving over 100+ problems on LeetCode and CodeStudio to enhance my logical and analytical skills.  

Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my understanding of **System Design** and **Backend Architecture** to build efficient and high-performance applications. I believe in writing clean, modular, and maintainable code while continuously exploring new tools, frameworks, and design patterns.  

I’m driven by curiosity, discipline, and the desire to create impactful software that adds real-world value. Coding for me isn’t just work — it’s a craft I enjoy refining every single day.

### 🧩 DSA & Programming
I have a strong foundation in **Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP) and **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Greedy, Backtracking).  

Solving coding problems helps me stay sharp, logical, and confident in breaking down complex challenges into simple, structured solutions. My goal is to merge algorithmic thinking with real-world application development for cleaner, faster, and scalable solutions.
